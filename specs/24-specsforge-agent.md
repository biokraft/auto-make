# 24. SpecsForge Agent Specification

## 1. Purpose
To provide an autonomous agent that embodies the SpecsForge framework, guiding users from a high-level product idea to a detailed, machine-readable specification library. This agent will automate the creation of the `specs/` directory and the root `SPECS.md` file, establishing the foundation for AI-driven development.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Interactive Discovery:** The agent must engage in a dialogue with the user to understand and refine project requirements, including business goals, feature scope, and technical constraints.
- **Specification Generation:** The agent must create and populate a `specs/` directory with individual Markdown files for each domain or technical topic identified during discovery.
- **Root Index Management:** The agent must create and maintain a root `SPECS.md` file that includes a project overview and a table linking to all files in the `specs/` directory.
- **Implementation Planning:** As its final step, the agent must generate a granular, phased implementation plan within `SPECS.md`.

## 3. Architecture & Data Flow
1.  **Invocation**: The user invokes the agent with a high-level goal (e.g., `automake "scaffold a spec for a new blog engine"`).
2.  **Delegation**: The `ManagerAgent` recognizes the "specification" or "scaffolding" intent and delegates the task to the `SpecsForgeAgent`.
3.  **Orchestration**: The `SpecsForgeAgent` begins an interactive session with the user, asking clarifying questions.
4.  **Execution**: As requirements become clear, the agent uses the `FileSystemAgent` and `CodingAgent` to create the directory structure and write the content for `specs/*.md` and `SPECS.md`.
5.  **Completion**: Once the user confirms the specs are complete, the agent generates the implementation plan in `SPECS.md` and concludes its session.

## 4. Implementation Notes
- This agent will be a new `ManagedAgent` available to the `ManagerAgent`.
- The agent's core logic will be to follow the loop defined in the SpecsForge framework: Discovery -> Spec Writing -> Root Indexing -> Iteration.
- The agent should use the standard SPEC template for all generated spec files.

## 5. Out of Scope
- Writing any implementation code or tests. The agent's sole output is the specification library.
- Executing any commands other than file system and writing operations.
